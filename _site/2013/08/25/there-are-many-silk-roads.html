<div class="post">
<p>Someone at my company recently moderated a discussion on the
structure and organization of tech companies. She brought back a little gem -
an argument by an Etsy executive that they purposely use boring technologies
like PHP, and avoid new-fangled stuff like the plague.</p>

<p>As a developer at a startup, I puked in my mouth a little bit. I&#39;ve read Paul Graham&#39;s
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Beating the Averages</a>. Of course we have
to be using the latest and greatest! Otherwise we&#39;ll be left in the dust.
Besides, PHP is like a rusty hammer, usable maybe, but why wouldn&#39;t you just
get a new hammer dammit?</p>

<p>So, as any know-it-all engineer would do, I brought up this affront to an Etsy
engineer, expecting a chorus of agreement. It didn&#39;t go quite as expected.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course we use boring technologies,&quot; the Etsy engineer said, &quot;it&#39;s only
boring because it&#39;s proven and easy to hire for.&quot; The essence of his
argument was that, when they&#39;re hiring, they&#39;re not interesting in
that person&#39;s passion for any particular technology - regardless of whether
Etsy uses it or not. They&#39;re interested in their passion for the product.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting perspective. When interviewing, I of course take culture
fit into account. Everyone does, whether they realize it or not. But I also
look for people who are passionate about their craft. For example, I&#39;ll often
screen for knowledge in functional programming because it seems
like a good indicator of passion.</p>

<p>But it turns out this is not the only route to riches. While Paul Graham wrote
on about the blub paradox, Etsy made bank developing on the most awful
programming language of modern existence. Maybe the road more traveled is not
so bad after all.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s plenty of companies prospering on the cutting edge. We
continue to use pretty new stuff at my company, despite the
reasonable counter-arguments. It&#39;s at least more fun that way. And maybe one
day we&#39;ll fail, but if we do, it won&#39;t be because we chose Go over Java. There
are, after all, many silk roads, and they all lead to profit.</p>
